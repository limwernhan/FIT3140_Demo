# FIT3140_Demo
This is the demo for the class later. This is done at the master itself.
I also added staged changes just for fun. There are more implications actually which I will let you to figure it out as I am not a Git expert.

# Now time to create a branch
We can use git branch to create a Python branch
Also created a Python FIle

## HelloWorld.py
Simple python file to print hello world

# With this, we have already merged the branch back into the master
It can be done via these simple steps
1. Push the branch to the origin (via git push)
2. Switch to the master (via git checkout)
3. Update the local master with remote master (via git pull)
4. Merge the branch into the local master (via git merge)
5. Push local master to origin master (via git push)
